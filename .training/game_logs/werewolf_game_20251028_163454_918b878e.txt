[DAY PHASE]

[DISCUSSION] Day 1
Alive players: Alice, Charlie, David, Eve, Frank, Grace, Henry, Ivy, Jack, Kate, Leo

--- Discussion Round 1 ---
Alice: It's still early, but I think we should pay close attention to anyone who seems overly eager to push a lynch without much discussion. Let's take our time and look for inconsistencies in people's reasoning as the day develops.
Charlie: I agree with Alice that we shouldn't rush into anything today. We should definitely be watching for people who try to push votes too quickly, but I'm also keeping an eye on anyone who stays completely silent or offers only vague agreement without adding to the discussion.
David: I think both Alice and Charlie are making good points about not rushing today. We should definitely be cautious of anyone trying to force an early vote, but I'm also wary of players who might use that reasoning as cover to contribute nothing substantial. Let's see who actually follows through with meaningful analysis as the day progresses.
Eve: David's point about using caution as cover is interesting - I'm already noticing a pattern where several people are just agreeing about not rushing without adding new perspectives. Let's see who actually brings forward concrete suspicions rather than just echoing the "take it slow" sentiment.
Frank: Eve's observation about people hiding behind caution is spot on. I'm noticing several players like Grace and Jack who haven't contributed beyond basic agreement with the "take it slow" approach. We should pressure the quieter ones to actually share some thoughts rather than just coasting on the consensus.
Grace: Frank makes a good point about pressuring quieter players, but I'm also keeping an eye on those who are quick to point fingers at the quiet ones. Someone trying to rally votes against low-contributors this early could be setting up an easy mislynch. Let's hear from Grace and Jack, but let's not let anyone use their silence as an excuse to push a bandwagon without proper discussion.
Henry: Grace raises a fair point about being wary of anyone trying to rally votes too easily, but I'm still concerned by how many people are just echoing the "let's be cautious" line without adding their own analysis. Frank was right to call out the quiet players, but now I'm also watching the people who immediately reframed that call-out as suspicious in itself. Let's hear some actual reads from everyone instead of just meta-commentary on the discussion.
Ivy: I've been thinking about Alice's initial comment about not rushing into a lynch - while it sounds reasonable on the surface, it feels like she's trying to set herself up as the voice of reason while potentially steering us away from catching early inconsistencies. Her opening feels a bit too calculated for someone who's supposedly just trying to be cautious.
Jack: Ivy's point about Alice is interesting - while I don't necessarily think Alice is suspicious for advocating caution, I do agree we should be looking at how people position themselves in these early discussions. Let's see if Alice follows up with actual substance or just continues playing the cautious card.
Kate: Ivy's suspicion of Alice feels a bit forced to me. Jumping on the very first person to advocate for caution seems like an easy way to look productive without actually scumhunting. Let's hear more from Ivy about who she actually trusts, because right now that push feels opportunistic.
Leo: Ivy's suspicion of Alice does feel a bit premature, but Kate's defense of Alice seems equally reactive. We're getting a lot of back-and-forth about the very first comment of the game, which feels like a distraction. I'm more interested in why Frank immediately tried to rally pressure on Grace and Jack specificallyâ€”that felt like an attempt to manufacture an easy target.
