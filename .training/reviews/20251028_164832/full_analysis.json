  "per_player": {
    "Alice": "Good early pressure but became a clear target. Should have been more cautious after being saved by witch. Tip: Don't reveal you were saved unless necessary.",
    "Bob": "Started reasonable pressure but became central to wolf strategy. Failed to defend effectively. Tip: Have stronger counter-arguments when under coordinated attack.",
    "Charlie": "Followed consensus without adding unique insights. Missed opportunities to lead. Tip: Develop independent reads rather than following trends.",
    "David": "Excellent wolf play, coordinated with pack on voting and discussion. Created effective misdirection. Tip: Maintain this level of coordination throughout.",
    "Eve": "Wasted save early, kept poison too long. Poor voting patterns revealed alignment. Tip: Use poison more aggressively when wolves are identified.",
    "Frank": "Recovered well from early suspicion with pack support. Good at blending. Tip: Vary discussion patterns to avoid detection.",
    "Grace": "Spotted wolf coordination pattern early. Strong analytical play. Tip: Push harder on confirmed patterns to convince others.",
    "Henry": "Good protection choices but failed to coordinate with seer. Tip: Communicate secretly with confirmed good roles when possible.",
    "Ivy": "Confirmed wolf but didn't share info effectively. Checked wrong targets. Tip: Share findings strategically before elimination.",
    "Jack": "Failed to use hunter threat effectively. Followed poor votes. Tip: Use your death power as leverage in discussions.",
    "Kate": "Solid wolf team play, consistent voting with pack. Good at maintaining cover. Tip: Vary discussion style to avoid pattern recognition.",
    "Leo": "Smart wolf play, created doubt about counter-wagons. Good at redirecting suspicion. Tip: Continue using reasonable doubt tactics."

  "overall": "Werewolves won through superior coordination and information control. They created effective misdirection in discussions and maintained voting discipline. Villagers failed to capitalize on early wolf sightings and the witch wasted her poison. The guardian and seer never coordinated effectively, allowing wolves to control the narrative.",
