  "per_player": {
    "Alice": "Good wolf play by advocating caution while avoiding suspicion. Successfully framed others. Tip: Coordinate voting more subtly to avoid detection.",
    "Bob": "No mistakes as first night kill. Final words tried to help villagers. Tip: As villager, always leave helpful analysis in final words.",
    "Charlie": "Effective wolf team coordination on kills. Stayed under radar while teammates took heat. Tip: Balance between contributing and staying hidden.",
    "David": "Poor hunter shot killed witch instead of confirmed wolf. Cost villagers their power roles. Tip: Verify targets before shooting as hunter.",
    "Eve": "Voted for herself which helped wolves eliminate villager. Failed to defend properly. Tip: Never self-vote; always present counter-arguments.",
    "Frank": "Aggressive wolf play calling out quiet players. Drew some suspicion but survived. Tip: Tone down aggression to avoid being targeted.",
    "Grace": "Protected Alice night 2, helping wolves. Voted correctly for Alice day 1. Tip: Be more careful with protection choices.",
    "Henry": "Reasonable analysis but failed to influence votes. Survived but couldn't stop wolf victory. Tip: Build stronger voting coalitions.",
    "Ivy": "Identified two wolves but couldn't share info effectively. Got killed by hunter. Tip: Share findings earlier with trusted players.",
    "Jack": "Witch wasted both potions. Killed by hunter's mistake. Poor resource management. Tip: Use potions proactively, not reactively.",
    "Kate": "Defended Alice incorrectly. Failed to see wolf patterns. Tip: Question defensive players more carefully.",
    "Leo": "Good wolf play redirecting suspicion. Helped eliminate Eve. Tip: Continue creating distractions from wolf teammates."

  "overall": "Werewolves won due to coordinated voting and effective misdirection. Villagers failed to organize despite seer finding wolves. Hunter's mistake killing witch sealed defeat. Wolves controlled narrative from day 1.",
