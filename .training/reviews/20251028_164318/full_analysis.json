  "per_player": {
    "Alice": "Good wolf play, coordinated with pack. Pushed mislynch on Frank effectively. Tip: Be less obvious in early coordination to avoid suspicion.",
    "Bob": "Reasonable villager play, noticed quiet players. Died night 2 without sharing key reads. Tip: Share specific wolf suspects before nightfall.",
    "Charlie": "Questioned early bandwagons correctly. Failed to stop Frank mislynch. Tip: Be more forceful in redirecting town when wolves control vote.",
    "David": "As hunter, played passively. Didn't use threat to influence votes. Tip: Announce hunter status early to deter wolf votes.",
    "Eve": "Tried to broaden discussion beyond quiet players. Voted wrong on Frank. Tip: Analyze voting blocs more carefully.",
    "Frank": "Used heal well but claimed poorly. Should have claimed witch earlier. Tip: Claim special role when under serious vote pressure.",
    "Grace": "Protected self then Alice (wolf). Poor protection choices hurt town. Tip: Protect confirmed town or seer, not unknowns.",
    "Henry": "Found two wolves as seer. Didn't share info before dying. Tip: Share wolf findings immediately to help town.",
    "Ivy": "Good wolf defense, shifted suspicion to Henry. Survived to endgame. Tip: As quiet wolf, engage more to seem town.",
    "Jack": "Effective wolf, defended packmate Ivy. Pushed mislynches successfully. Tip: Coordinate votes but avoid obvious pack behavior.",
    "Kate": "Solid wolf play, blended well with town. Supported pack narratives subtly. Tip: Maintain consistent voting patterns to avoid detection.",
    "Leo": "Reasonable villager analysis. Failed to identify wolf blocs. Tip: Track who votes together to find wolf teams."
  },
  "overall": "Werewolves won by controlling day 1 vote to eliminate witch Frank. Seer Henry found wolves but died before sharing information. Wolves coordinated voting blocs while villagers failed to identify patterns. Poor guardian choices and lack of information sharing doomed town.",
