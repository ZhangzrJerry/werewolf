    "Alice": "Played too passively. Failed to capitalize on being saved by witch. Improvement: Claim your saved status earlier to gain credibility.",
    "Bob": "Good wolf play. Created early misdirection and blended well. Improvement: Avoid being first to name specific players.",
    "Charlie": "Reasonable villager logic but lacked impact. Improvement: Build stronger voting alliances with confirmed goods.",
    "David": "Hunter was too quiet. Never used threat effectively. Improvement: Announce your role to deter wolves from targeting you.",
    "Eve": "Guardian protected wolves twice. Poor protection choices. Improvement: Protect suspected power roles, not quiet players.",
    "Frank": "Villager eliminated D1. Wrongly suspected Alice. Improvement: Don't make strong accusations without evidence.",
    "Grace": "Good witch play saving Alice. Held poison too long. Improvement: Use poison earlier on strong wolf suspects.",
    "Henry": "Solid wolf teamwork. Supported pack without drawing attention. Improvement: Coordinate voting patterns more naturally.",
    "Ivy": "Seer found wolf Kate but revealed too late. Improvement: Share findings immediately after confirming wolf.",
    "Jack": "Villager with good meta-analysis but seen as suspicious. Improvement: Frame consensus arguments more carefully.",
    "Kate": "Wolf survived seer check by staying quiet. Good deception. Improvement: Be more active in discussions to blend.",
    "Leo": "Excellent wolf play creating division. Mastered framing arguments. Improvement: Maintain consistent voting patterns."

  "overall": "Werewolves won through coordinated voting and creating villager infighting. They manipulated day 1 vote onto Frank, then maintained control by dividing villagers with meta-arguments about consensus. The seer discovered a wolf but revealed too late, and guardian protected wolves twice.",
