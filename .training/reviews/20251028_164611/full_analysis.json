  "per_player": {
    "Alice": "Good survival instincts but poor voting. Voted for Eve instead of confirmed wolf Kate. Tip: Trust Seer info and vote with confirmed allies.",
    "Bob": "Aggressive early callouts drew suspicion but created chaos. Wolf pack coordination was effective. Tip: Be less obvious in pushing misdirection.",
    "Charlie": "Good potion use saved Alice but wasted poison. Failed to eliminate confirmed wolf. Tip: Use poison on confirmed threats immediately.",
    "David": "Identified Kate as wolf but didn't push hard enough. Shared info too late. Tip: Reveal wolf findings immediately to guide votes.",
    "Eve": "Reasonable analysis but voted poorly. Failed to recognize wolf patterns. Tip: Track voting blocs to identify wolf teams.",
    "Frank": "Unfortunate early elimination. Correctly suspected Alice/Bob but couldn't convince others. Tip: Build alliances before being targeted.",
    "Grace": "Average villager play. Followed consensus without critical analysis. Tip: Question bandwagons instead of joining them.",
    "Henry": "Effective wolf play pushing Kate narrative. Created town division. Tip: Coordinate with pack on narrative timing.",
    "Ivy": "Good protection choices but poor voting. Protected Alice but voted against her. Tip: Align protection with voting strategy.",
    "Jack": "Solid wolf performance blending with town. Supported pack narratives subtly. Tip: Maintain consistent town persona throughout.",
    "Kate": "Survived as confirmed wolf due to town chaos. Wolf pack defense was coordinated. Tip: Let packmates defend you subtly.",
    "Leo": "Good analysis but ineffective execution. Spotted wolf patterns but couldn't rally votes. Tip: Build credibility early to lead votes."
  },
  "overall": "Werewolves won through coordinated misdirection and exploiting town indecision. They created multiple false narratives early, divided the village on irrelevant targets, and protected Kate despite Seer identification. Town failed to act on confirmed information and wasted votes on villagers instead of known wolves.",
