    "Alice": "Died night 1, no chance to play. Tip: As first victim, leave a legacy statement to guide villagers.",
    "Bob": "Good wolf play, avoided early suspicion despite Seer check. Tip: Blend in more naturally, don't over-defend packmates.",
    "Charlie": "Poor potion management, wasted self-protection. Tip: Save potion for confirmed good roles or self on critical nights.",
    "David": "Pushed for info but got framed as suspicious. Tip: Frame questions neutrally to avoid wolf misdirection.",
    "Eve": "Ineffective self-protection night 1. Tip: Protect high-value targets like Seer, not yourself early.",
    "Frank": "Solid wolf, redirected suspicion well. Tip: Coordinate voting patterns with pack to avoid ties.",
    "Grace": "Overly defensive, drew Seer's attention. Tip: Wolves should avoid strong reactions to mild accusations.",
    "Henry": "Effective pack support in discussions. Tip: Reinforce pack narratives subtly without appearing coordinated.",
    "Ivy": "Too quiet, self-voted. Tip: Contribute early to avoid being labeled low-priority lynch.",
    "Jack": "Found two wolves but couldn't leverage info. Tip: Share findings carefully before you are killed.",
    "Kate": "Hunter was too passive. Tip: Use threat of retaliation to deter wolves from killing you.",
    "Leo": "Reasonable analysis but lacked influence. Tip: Build alliances early to amplify correct reads."

  "overall": "Werewolves won due to superior coordination and information control. They eliminated key threats at night while creating enough town confusion during the day. The Seer was killed before revealing his wolf finds, and the Witch wasted her potion. Villagers failed to unite on clear suspects, allowing wolves to manipulate votes.",
