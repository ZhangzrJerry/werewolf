    "Alice": "Died night 1. No major mistakes. Tip: As first victim, leave clearer suspicion in last words to guide village.",
    "Bob": "Aggressive day 1 push on quiet players drew suspicion. Survived by blending in later. Tip: Less aggressive early game framing.",
    "Charlie": "Survived witch save. Reasonable arguments but couldn't identify wolves. Tip: Analyze voting blocs more carefully.",
    "David": "Protected Charlie successfully but misread Grace as good. Tip: Guardian should protect suspected power roles, not quiet players.",
    "Eve": "Revealed hunter role after elimination, shot wrong target (Leo). Tip: Hunter should only reveal if certain of wolf target.",
    "Frank": "Played subtly, avoided early suspicion, voted with pack. Solid wolf performance. Tip: Maintain this balanced deception.",
    "Grace": "Protected night 2, successfully framed others. Good wolf teamwork. Tip: Continue deflecting suspicion onto villagers.",
    "Henry": "Followed consensus, lacked independent analysis. Tip: Question bandwagon votes more aggressively.",
    "Ivy": "Checked Alice & Charlie (both good), but didn't share info effectively. Tip: Seer must reveal strategically before dying.",
    "Jack": "Saved Charlie correctly but wasted poison. Poor information use. Tip: Witch must use poison on strong wolf suspects.",
    "Kate": "Solid wolf play, voted with pack, avoided suspicion. Good pack coordination. Tip: Maintain low-profile deception.",
    "Leo": "Died to hunter shot. Quiet villager, minimal impact. Tip: Villagers must contribute more to discussion."
  },
  "overall": "Werewolves won due to superior coordination and village errors. Wolves framed villagers effectively while village mislynched hunter day 1. Poor information management by seer/witch and chaotic voting doomed village. Hunter's revenge kill on villager sealed defeat.",
